## Objective

- [x] Build a [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io) app that is functionally similar to this: <https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx.>

### User Stories

- [x] My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding `id="main"`, which contains all other elements.

- [x] Should see an element with a corresponding `id="title"`, which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").
- [x] Should see a `div` element with a corresponding `id="img-div"`.
- [x] Within the `img-div` element, I should see an element with a corresponding `id="img-caption"` that contains textual content describing the image shown in `img-div`.    
- [x] Should see an element with a corresponding `id="tribute-info"`, which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.   
- [x] Should see an `a` element with a corresponding `id="tribute-link"`, which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of `target` and set it to `_blank` in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. `target="_blank"`).
- [x] The `img` element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
- [x] The `img` element should be centered within its parent element.
